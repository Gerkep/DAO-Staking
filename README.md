# DAO-Staking
Two approaches when creating a DAO with staking function. 
(In both of them I implemented a mechanism which enables owner of the DAO 
to adjust minimum votes needed to reach a consensus based on last period activity)

1)
Rewarding users based on number of his NFTs and past votings. 
Every voting can have a different reward value which is being multiplied by mentioned earlier values. 
User tokens number increase after every voting he/she make. 
User has a possibility to claim earned tokens whenever he/she wants to.

2)
User gets constant rate no matter the activity.
